## Brainstorm Ideas

*TRON
**Tron was a movie released on July 9, 1982. The sequel, Legacy, was released on December 17, 2010. Tron as a visual design aesthetic has influenced graphic and structural designers, film makers, and musicians. As a story it talks about our immersion into computers and technology before a lot of that came to be. As a film, Tron broke new ground by taking available technology and using it in the visual medium in ways that hadn't been done before. In order to achieve the look of the first film, the effects team had to go in and hand light every single frame of the movie. BY HAND. (60 frames/sec X 60 sec) X 69 minutes = 248,400 frames. So yeah, that was a thing.

In 1982 it would be weird to see someone walking around with a small device with more computing power than that which was used on board a space craft that took our astronauts to the moon. Now its commonplace to the point that its weird if you don't have one. Twenty years from now will it be weird if we don't all have some form of wearable technology, augmenting our reality? If so, I would like a Tron skin for my iWear. 

The most important thing in the look of Tron is the lighting aspect. The characters, the buildings, the landscape, the vehicles, all have a specific lighting scheme. The color palette is also very simple. The colors they use are White, Black, Blue, Red, Green, and Yellow. Everything that is a light source has a glow about it. Everything that isn't a light source tends to be shaded dark and somewhat flat. All of your attention is going to be focused on the thing giving off light. 

The font associated with Tron is also very specific. In the original movie as well as in the sequel, the font is blocky in some areas and curved in others, as if it had been formed out of neon light tubes. This is a specific style that I would like to apply to the Google Doodle.
